              Application Security Testing: A Comparison of SAST, DAST, IAST, and RASP

              Application security testing is an essential part of the software development lifecycle, as it helps to
              identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities and security risks in applications before they can be
              exploited. There are several different approaches to application security testing, including static
              application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), interactive application
              security testing (IAST), and runtime application self-protection (RASP).

                <b>Static application security testing (SAST)</b> is a type of testing that analyzes the source code or
                binaries of an application to identify potential vulnerabilities. SAST tools are typically used early in
                the development process, and can help developers identify issues such as insecure code practices, input
                validation flaws, and other potential vulnerabilities.

              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Dynamic application security testing (DAST)</b> is a type of testing that analyzes the runtime
                behavior of
                an application to identify potential vulnerabilities. DAST tools are typically used later in the
                development process, and can help developers identify issues such as injection vulnerabilities,
                cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, and other runtime vulnerabilities.

              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Interactive application security testing (IAST)</b> is a type of testing that combines the
                capabilities of
                SAST and DAST, by analyzing both the source code and runtime behavior of an application to identify
                potential vulnerabilities. IAST tools can provide a more comprehensive view of an application&apos;s security
                posture, and can help developers identify issues that may not be detectable using SAST or DAST alone.

              <p>
                <b>Runtime application self-protection (RASP)</b> is a type of security technology that is designed to
                protect
                an application from attacks in real-time. RASP tools work by monitoring the runtime behavior of an
                application and blocking or mitigating malicious activity when it is detected.

                Understanding the benefits and limitations of different application security testing approaches is
                important for developers, as it can help them choose the most appropriate tools and techniques for their
                specific needs. By using a combination of different application security testing approaches, developers
                can create more secure and robust applications that are better able to withstand attacks.
